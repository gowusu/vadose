Description: This R function computes infiltration, particle size distribution,
    saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil water retention. The are 12
    infiltration functions in the package: they include BEST, offin, Green
    and Ampt,Philip, SCS (US-Soil Conservation Service), Kostiakov, Horton,
    Swartzendruber,Modified Kostiakov, Revised Modified Kostiakov, brutsaert and
    valiantzas. There are 15 particle size distribution functions in the package
    and they include logistic models, van Genuchten models, Fredlund models, a
    logarithmic model, Andersson models, and Gompterz. van Genuchten water retention
    and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity model with internal saturated hydraulic
    conductivity functions are also implemented. There are also 12 goodness of fit
    tests that include AIC, BIC, R2, RMSE, NRMSE, etc.
