Description: The vadose package can derive soil water retention  and hydraulic conductivity curves using 
    models from the Offin Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (OFEST) and 
    Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (BEST). There are also many infiltration 
    functions in the package and they include Green and Ampt,Philip, 
    SCS (US-Soil Conservation Service), Kostiakov, Horton,Swartzendruber,Modified Kostiakov, 
    Revised Modified Kostiakov, brutsaert and valiantzas. 
    There are 15 particle size distribution functions in the package
    and they include logistic models, van Genuchten models, Fredlund models, a
    logarithmic model, Andersson models, and Gompterz. van Genuchten water retention
    and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity model with internal saturated hydraulic
    conductivity functions are also implemented. There are also 12 goodness of fit
    tests and they include AIC, BIC, R-square, RMSE, NRMSE, etc.
